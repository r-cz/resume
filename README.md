# LaTeX Resume

This resume is built using the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template, which provides a modern and professional LaTeX resume design.

## Getting Started

This project uses VS Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension for seamless compilation and preview. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Install the LaTeX Workshop extension in VS Code
3. Install a complete TeX distribution:
   - For macOS: Install MacTeX from https://tug.org/mactex/
   - For Windows: Install MiKTeX from https://miktex.org
   - For Linux: Install TeX Live using your package manager

## Building the Resume

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can build the resume directly in VS Code:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Open `resume.tex`
3. Press `âŒ˜ + S` (macOS) or `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) to save, which will trigger automatic compilation
4. The PDF preview will appear in a new tab within VS Code

Alternatively, you can click the "Build LaTeX" button in VS Code's toolbar (usually looks like a play button).

## Project Structure

- `resume.tex` - Main resume file containing personal information and section imports
- `awesome-cv.cls` - Template class file defining the resume's style and layout

## Fonts

This template uses three main fonts:
- Roboto (for headers)

- Font Awesome (for icons)

These fonts are included in the `fonts/` directory, so no additional font installation is needed.

## Customization

- Colors: Change the `\colorlet{awesome}{...}` command in `resume.tex` to use a different color scheme. Available options include:
  - awesome-emerald
